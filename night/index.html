      <h1>What's uppppppp</h1>
      
        <p>LONDON — In the giddy aftermath of England’s 2-0 quarterfinal victory over Sweden in the World Cup on Saturday, Andy Ward staggered out of a pub and into a tattoo parlor. He stripped off his shirt and bared his chest to a shaver. Then a tattoo artist etched St. George’s Cross — the English flag — over his heart.</p>

        <p class="huge"> Mr. Ward, 51, a decorator, concedes he might have been a bit tipsy at the time. But he doesn’t regret his decision, at all.</p>

        <p> “No one expected this,” he said on Monday, sipping a pint at a southwest London pub and showing off his new tattoo. “We only dreamed of getting so far. We’re not used to this kind of success.”</p>

        <p> He was talking about the fact that England hasn’t won the World Cup since 1966 — and, more recently, has endured one World Cup disappointment after another. Suddenly, a young, dynamic team led by a manager who has become an unexpected national hero is two wins away from reclaiming the cup, while England, which has been cleaved by politics and hasn’t had much to celebrate of late, is going, well, nuts.
          </p>
        <p>This World Cup feels like a distraction from everything,” said Michael Gibbons, 44, author of “When Football Came Home: England, the English and Euro 96” who ticked off a list of tragedies last year, such as the deadly fire at the Grenfell Tower housing block in London, or the terror attacks in Manchester and London — not to mention the ugly aftermath of the Brexit vote.</p>

        <p>“The divisiveness over the Brexit vote and what that has done to society is obvious,” he said, adding: “So the England run has been a kind of serotonin to all of that.”</p>

        <p> Far from everyone is basking in England’s newfound warmth and fuzziness. Croatia, which is playing England on Wednesday in the semifinals, has very different opinions, for one. And large parts of the rest of Britain — especially sections of Scotland and Wales — would be absolutely pleased to see their English neighbors lose, and lose badly.

      <p>The excitement has even moved tennis officials at Wimbledon to soften their policy requiring phones be shut off during matches to allow fans at Centre Court to watch the soccer games, albeit without the sound. (Some players noticed when English soccer fans left the stands during one of the team’s matches.) Grown men have broken down in tears and sung a famous English soccer song, “Three Lions,” which is again topping music charts, 22 years after its release.
